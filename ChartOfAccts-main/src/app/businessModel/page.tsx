      <p className="mb-4">
        The chart of accountants is a structured listing of all accounts used in
        the general ledger of our organization. It provides a systematic and
        organized way of recording financial transactions and categorizing them
        into various accounts, such as assets, liabilities, income, and
        expenses.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our chart of accountants is designed to meet industry standards and to
        provide clarity and consistency in financial reporting. Each account is
        assigned a unique code or number to facilitate easy identification and
        retrieval of financial information.
